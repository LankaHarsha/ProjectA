So big that it tends to overshadow what's really important: 'meaning-making'. The ever growing, never-ending avalanche of data is of no use unless companies can derive insights that g\t\t  \t\t \t\t\trow revenue and reduce costs. Business analytics may not always excavate the right insights from the masses of data available. That's where the new science of meaning-making comes in.  Here are some of the  interesting trends that emerged in  'Cognizant and Oxford Economics' survey of 300 businesses in the U.S. and Europe. The infographic  presents the top European takeaways from the survey.","set_names":"Analytics,Big Data Analytics,Business Process Services,Business Reimagined,Code Halos,Cross Industry,Digital Business,Perspectives Article,Tier 1","industry_name":"Cross Industry","theme_name":"Code Halos,Digital Business","visually_url":"http://visual.ly/business-analytics-europe-new-science-meaning-making-emerges?view=true","image_path":"http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/BusinessAnalyticsinEuropeTheNewScienceofMeaningMakingEmerges_53c50e3de79d0_w1500.jpg","thumbnail":"https://codex.cognizant.com/includes/phpThumb.php?img=http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/BusinessAnalyticsinEuropeTheNewScienceofMeaningMakingEmerges_53c50e3de79d0_w1500.jpg"},{"id":28,"asset_id":"1062","source_id":"115468","title":"Countering Showrooming","created_date":"2014-03-21","description":"Showrooming, a growing phenomenon in which consumers \"try\" a product in the physical world and \"buy\" it for less online, not surprisingly, frustrates traditional retailers. As online retail grows and \t\t  \t\t \t\t\taccounts for a greater share of consumer wallets, brick and mortar retailers are struggling under the mistaken notion that showrooming is as inevitable as shoplifting.  Not necessarily.   Understanding the showrooming's drivers and responding intelligently, can help retailers counter the threat and convince shoppers to buy more at brick-and-mortar stores.  This infographic presents key insights from our \"2012 Shopper Experience Study\" conducted with RIS magazine. It provides pointers on how to provide consumers the shopping experience they desire.","set_names":"Perspectives Article,Retail,Tier 1","industry_name":"Retail","theme_name":"","visually_url":"http://visual.ly/countering-showrooming?view=true","image_path":"http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/countering-showrooming_532c0f5017b1c_w1500.jpg","thumbnail":"https://codex.cognizant.com/includes/phpThumb.php?img=http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/countering-showrooming_532c0f5017b1c_w1500.jpg"},{"id":29,"asset_id":"1061","source_id":"115465","title":"Retail: Staying on top of Digital Trends","created_date":"2014-03-21","description":"Our survey of 3,800 shoppers found that 64% of online shoppers would like to see more consistent information between stores and online channels. Also, 60% of online shoppers surveyed sought more inter\t\t  \t\t \t\t\tactive experiences in stores. Shopper gripes with online channels include unclear information and undesirable policies and limited cross-channel integration. Retailers can address these by leveraging digital assets in stores. Another trend retailers must prepare for is the growing influence of social. While North America lags the APAC region, there is evidence that social influence will grow significantly in North America, too. According to our survey, shoppers seek exclusive promotions and sales on social network platforms. They desire sneak peeks at new products and the chance to provide feedback. Shoppers would also like to make purchases and avail of customer service over social platforms, our survey reveals. They also seek fun, interactive experiences on these platforms. Even shoppers over 65 years of age, who say they are slow to adopt technology, love Facebook.
